      <p>
	This project is actually solving a very practical problem for
	me. I have a pretty bad dust allergy, so living in a space
	filled with dust and other particles can seriously affect many
	aspects of my life. I also have seasonal allergies, so at
	certain times of year, it can be really tough to tell if my
	reactions are coming from dust or pollen.
      </p>

      <p>
	Enter the sensor! I want to build a device that can clear up
	this confusion and help me decide what to do. I found
	an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3709">air quality
	sensor on Adafruit</a>, and set off to design the system.

	As of writing, my air quality sensor has yet to arrive. So,
	I've been building the data pipeline that goes with the
	sensor; this is how I'll actually access readings from the
	sensor. Because I don't know the particulars of the sensor
	yet, I kept the design pretty general
